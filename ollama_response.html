<div class='response'><p>The sun hangs heavy, a languid orange orb in the sky, casting long, shimmering shadows on the rippling water in the backyard pond. Flies dance in the warm morning light, shimmering like jewels trapped within a glass. A lone cast, a ripple in the center of the pond, sends a flurry of tiny flies spiraling through the air before they land with a soft plop in the water. They shimmer and gleam in the sunlight, a thousand tiny stars shimmering on a velvet canvas. A child giggles, his eyes wide with wonder as he watches the ballet of the flies, the sun-kissed surface reflecting the vibrant dance of the tiny fish beneath the surface.</p><span class='timestamp'>sunday, march 03, at 07 am</span></div>
